/* This file describes TriCore derivatives known to the toolchain.
   Before including this file, define a macro

   DEF_DEVICE(NAME, TARGET_NAME, CORE, LD_MCPU)

   Name:         Name of the device as specified with -mcpu=<Name>.
                 Used to built-in define __<NAME>__ (allcaps).

   TARGET_NAME:  String to be used in built-in macro __TARGET_NAME__.

   Core:         The core architecture as string according to -mtc<Core>.
                 This will pick the multilib variant and be used for
                 the assembler by means of -mtc<Core>.

   ld_mcpu:      The core as for tricore-ld --mcpu=<ld_mcpu>.
                 The linker supports cores like 'tc16p'.  This is for
                 future use and currently we have <ld_mcpu> = tc<Core>.
